Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis. One of the most important aspects of AI is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms allow AI systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This makes AI systems well-suited for tasks that are difficult or impossible to program directly, such as recognizing objects in images or natural language processing.
